                <h2>Itachi of the leaf</h2>
                <p>He is an ANBU Captain and a prodigy from Konohagakure's famed Uchiha clan, the son of Fugaku Uchiha, the clan's chief, and Mikoto Uchiha, and the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha.Since his childhood, Itachi was quiet and insightful. He lived at a distance, observing individuals and ideas without getting directly involved so he can fully understand them. Although this prevented him from becoming close to many people, it enabled him to think and act without prejudice or preconceptions, instead evaluating things strictly on their own merits. He would think about shinobi and origins of the village and its future. For this reason he never had the self-righteous loyalty to his clan that so common among the Uchiha: the Curse of Hatred. Although he loved his family and wanted the best for his clan, he knew there were more important things than the Uchiha's aspirations. Despite being a pacifist, Itachi felt his own needs were secondary to the greater goods; to that end he became a shinobi. He trained tirelessly to improve himself as quickly as he could and subjected himself to the shinobi life's inconveniences without complaint for the simple motivation to be useful to others</p>
                <p>He became an S-rank missing-nin as he participated in the murder of his entire clan, defected from the village, then joined the criminal organization Akatsuki. This causes Sasuke to desire revenge at any cost and later turn to Orochimaru while seeking the power to kill his older brother, making Itachi indirectly responsible for Sasuke's turn to villainy. Because of the Uchiha clan massacre, Itachi was vilified and served as a supporting antagonist for a large part of the series (until his death). However, after Itachi died out of sickness during the fight against Sasuke, it is revealed that Itachi was actually a double-spy that killed his clan on orders from higher-ups. No one in the Hidden Leaf village apart from a few important people knew that the Uchiha clan was plotting an insurrection primarily concerned with themselves, so Itachi killed them all primarily concerned with protecting the Hidden Leaf Village and his younger brother.</p>
                <p>Although Itachi fulfills his wish to die in battle against Sasuke (who had been misguided into hating Itachi like everyone else), his plan to make his younger brother a hero of Konoha fails when Sasuke learns the truth from Obito Uchiha. The truth makes Sasuke feel great grief and sympathy for his older brother, then he decides that the Hidden Leaf Village needs to be destroyed in vengeance for ruining Itachi's life. Itachi is later resurrected by Kabuto during the Fourth Great Ninja war. With Sasuke's help, Itachi heroically stops Kabuto and uses the mind-altering Izami Genjutsu to redeem Kabuto and undo the resurrection technique, getting rid of the undead army of powerful shinobi. Despite knowing that he had failed his little brother, Itachi passed on again with the faith that Naruto would redeem Sasuke, which turned out to be true.</p>
